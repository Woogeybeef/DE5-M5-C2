# Part A - Deliverable

## Exercise Objective:
Design a database schema for a theoretical online shopping website. Identify necessary entities, attributes, and relationships. Normalise the data into First and Second Normal Forms. The given data follows certain data collection logic; first name, last name, email, etc., but is otherwise not fully normalised nor is all relevant data collected together in the right place.

## Required Tables:
Based on the typical functionalities of an online shopping website, the following tables are essential:

- Customers
- Products
- Orders

Additionally, to capture the relationships between these entities, we may need association tables, such as:

- Order_Items (to link orders and products)
- Customer_Addresses (to store multiple addresses for a customer, or single addresses for multiple customers)
- Categories (for products)

## Task:

1.	Identify the entities and attributes in the given data.
2.	Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visualize the relationships between entities.
3.	Convert the data into First Normal Form (1NF) by eliminating repeating groups.
4.	Convert the data into Second Normal Form (2NF) by removing partial dependencies.
5.	Create an Agile deployment plan with 2 weekly sprints. 
Note: This is a simplified example. Real-world database designs often involve more complex relationships and considerations.


# Part B - Submission

Task: Upload your analysis to the main repo under Day_3/Submissions with a folder in your name!

 1. Delete your old forked repo.
 2. In the orginal repo, create a new branch with your name using "git checkout -b branchName".
 3. Look up how to create a pull request. Set me as the reviewer (niroshsuthagar-qa).
 4. I will review this and leave a feedback. 
 5. Once approved, push your changes and merge your branch.
 6. Once complete and on the main repo, you may delete your old branch.
